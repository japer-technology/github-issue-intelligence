## File existence behavior

All `ISSUE-INTELLIGENCE-*` workflows run `.issue-intelligence/lifecycle/ISSUE-INTELLIGENCE-ENABLED.ts` as the first blocking guard step. If this file is missing, the guard exits non-zero and prints:

> Issue Intelligence disabled by missing ISSUE-INTELLIGENCE-ENABLED.md

That fail-closed guard blocks all subsequent ISSUE-INTELLIGENCE workflow logic.
